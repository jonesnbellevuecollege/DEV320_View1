                <p>
                    The bulk of my experience has been in assisting with the planning, buildout, and support phases of my company's ETL pipeline for our most popular SaaS product. I deal with a significant volume of highly sensitive data as a key part of my role in facilitating it's migration from one integrated system into another, which means I have a trained eye for detail and a strong preference for perfection. Security is a big concern for me in the realm of technology, especially with the rise in AI tools. Technological security standards seem to be evolving everyday as a bare necessity to keep up with the advancements around AI use. This electronic "wild west" draws me to want to develop applications with a strong emphasis on security and user protection.
